- ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! Iâ€™m CJ Jones
- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy working with libraries/frameworks such as React and React Native Expo
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking to grow in my journey as a software engineer by transitioning from freelance; I plan to start a career at a company where communication, passion, and innovation go hand in hand. I am also currently studying data structures & algorithms.
- ðŸ¤˜ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects on varying topics. One of my strongest passions is entertainment in all of its various forms, so I would love to collaborate with individuals or groups on anything music, tv/movie, or gaming-related.
